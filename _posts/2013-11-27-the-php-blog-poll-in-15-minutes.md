<p>Are you a Rubyst? Do the words &ldquo;Blog in 15 minutes&rdquo; sound familiar?</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/63022489">Here</a> you can find something similar but in PHP. </p>
<p><a href="http://phalconphp.com/en/">Phalcon</a> is a web development framework (another one!) that claims to be easy to use but also the fastest among its family.</p>
<p>How can it be so fast? Simple, it is packed as a C extension! The drawback? If you need to hack or fix some bugs in the core you must know C :P</p>

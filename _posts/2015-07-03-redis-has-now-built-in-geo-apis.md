This week [@antirez](http://antirez.com) merged the [GEO APIs developed by Matt Stancliff](https://matt.sh/redis-geo) in Redis. They will be released with Redis 3.2.

IMHO this is really a great addition to Redis. At the moment redis.io still doesnâ€™t list the new commands, but you can check the website of the original GEO API implementation to have an insight of the commands.

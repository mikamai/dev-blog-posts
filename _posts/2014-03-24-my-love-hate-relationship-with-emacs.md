<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Emanuel and I have a problem: I love and hate Emacs.</p>

<p>Today instead of offering a solution of a known problem or posting a link to cool stuff, I&rsquo;m here to ask for hints: I want to hear from other Emacs users what do they use to address my UI problems.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a Vim user (compulsory editor flame war image here) but I wanted to take the red pill and try to embrace Emacs for a while and then take an informed decision. Will I be able to go back? Well it seems I wasn&rsquo;t and I want to stick with Emacs, the change wasn&rsquo;t easy: I always kept relapsing to my editor of choice due to impending deadlines, but almost a year ago I decided to take the plunge and I installed only Emacs on my new laptop (I am on OSX, use Emacs with Cocoa installed via homebrew), no other serious editor available.</p>

<p>And I loved it! For a RoR developer, Emacs was a perfectly viable solution, I fell in love with its bindings (after the necessary hiatus to forget dd to delete a line) and my muscle memory reset to the new environment.</p>

<p>But I don&rsquo;t always write software and I&rsquo;d love to use Emacs (switching editors is almost more taxing than context switching) to jot down thoughts and write articles, and whenever I do, I feel it goes in the way. When I thought of writing this article I was sure I&rsquo;d come up with a list of different problems, but in the end I found out my gripes are mainly with the UI and almost anything points to the buffers. My Emacs feels like a one window program, I usually split the screen in 2 or 3 parts, but I&rsquo;d love to use tabs or multiple windows to arrange my thoughts and get the most of my screen estate. Sure, I could navigate through buffers, but sometimes it feels like throwing everything in a black hole where it&rsquo;s hard to get something back or at least know what&rsquo;s there.</p>

<p>And when I need to start some plain text editing, I&rsquo;d love to find a zero friction way to just open a tab and start jotting down words, like a markdown default mode for empty files (did I mention I don&rsquo;t want to even start thinking of where I want to save the file beforehand?) something that will make my Notational Velocity setup obsolete.</p>

<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s no solution (I doubt it) and I&rsquo;ll have to keep using nv, Emacs and Xcode or there&rsquo;s a simple one and someone will just RTFM-me, but I&rsquo;d love to hear what&rsquo;s your setup and how you addressed similar problems. So, any suggestion is most welcomed, you can find me on Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/onigiri">@onigiri</a>) and no, please, don&rsquo;t reply with suggestions to switch back to Vim or Sublime and that Textmate is open source now, or Atom, the new kid on the block. It&rsquo;s not the goal of this article ;)</p>

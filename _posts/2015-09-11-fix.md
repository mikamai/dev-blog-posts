<a href='http://fixrb.org/'>Fix</a><div class="link_description"><p>Last week I discovered this little new testing framework and I am finding it’s quite intriguing with its unusual syntax.</p>
<p>What I like the most is that you have to explicitly set a subject in the “describe” block and explicitly set a method call with params in the expectation block, thus making pretty clear what’s going on with the tests.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that the framework offers different levels of specification via MUST, SHOULD and MAY keywords. Look at the following example:</p>

<pre><code>
require 'fix'

person = String.new ('yukihiro matsumoto')

Fix.describe person do
  on :split, ' ' do
    it { MUST Eql: ['yukihiro', 'matsumoto'] }
  end

  on :capitalize do
    it { SHOULD Eql: 'Yukihiro Matsumoto' }
  end

  on :to_json do
    it { MAY Eql: "{ "name": "yukihiro", "surname": "matsumoto"}" }
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>The last two tests report an info rather than an error because their expectations are not strict (MAY allows non existent methods to be called, while SHOULD allows different results but requires the method to exists).<br /></p></div>

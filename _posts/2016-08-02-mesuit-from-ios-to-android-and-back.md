A smartphone with a sophisticated design like an iPhone but with inside all the flexibility that Android OS allows.

This is the dream of many users, and many manufacturers have tried (with poor results, editor’s note).

From China comes the first solution to meet this need, it is called MESUIT and is a cover for the iPhone that allows the smartphone of Cupertino to use the Android operating system.

But let’s take a step back…

It all starts in the mind of Nick Lee, developer best known for being the one that has installed Windows 95 on an Apple Watch, who wants to to find a meeting point between the green robot and the bitten apple.

By exploiting the lighting socket of an iPhone like a network port, it transmits to the smartphone a video signal whose source is an Android smartphone. The next step was to create a special cover containing all the hardware needed to run Android.

Starting from this crazy idea Jijia, a Chinese company, has started to develop MESUIT.

MESUIT is a case that makes possible to use Android or better Mesuit OS, a light version of the operating system, on an iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6s and 6s Plus. Its technical features are:
<ul>
 	<li>additional battery of 1.700mAh or 2,550 mAh</li>
 	<li>32, 64 and 128 GB of memory usable both Mesuit OS that iOS</li>
 	<li>nano SIM slot</li>
 	<li>MediaTek MT6753 processor</li>
 	<li>2 GB of RAM</li>
 	<li>a network adapter 802.11b / g / n</li>
 	<li>Bluetooth 4.0</li>
</ul>

According to many users the user experience is considerable, it makes you forget that you are not holding a regular Android smartphone but an iPhone.

Since it uses the lighting socket of the iPhone this feature can not be used while charging the phone.

But Jijia and the MESUIT team are already thinking about the next step. It appears they’re thinking the realization of a spaciale case that allows you to run iOS on any Android smartphone.

MESUIT is currently available only in China, but it might become available sooner or later in our stores too.

Google recently released a new device family designed for emerging markets known as <b>Android One</b>.

The Android One family includes a set of smartphone with an hardware perfectly tuned for Android, that carries the latest release of the green robot (currently some terminals have been upgraded to Android 5.1, version not present on any other device). This ensemble allow to have a performing smartphone, able to run the latest applications.

<i>“With Android One we set the bar to be a great experience and a great device software. We really want to bring in a whole new set of people who have never tried a smartphone before”</i> - Sundar Pichai

Android One is designed to provide a faster, smoother, more responsive experience.

Google has all the resources to manage the SW part but for the realization of the HW it had to entrust some local producers which could join biggest names like HTC, Asus, Acer and Lenovo. These smartphone made by different manufacturers have in common besides the SW also features HW:
<ul>
 	<li>Front and rear camera</li>
 	<li>Quad core processor</li>
 	<li>1GB RAM</li>
 	<li>Micro SD Card</li>
 	<li>Dual SIM</li>
</ul>
The Android One family may be considered as the “entry level” of the most popular Nexus family, on the other side they have a different philosophy.

These terminals have been designed completely from the big G, so it could control not only the SW part but also the technical characteristics of the devices.

Being also designed for emerging markets the Android One family has a low price (&lt;$ 200), winning feature of the Nexus devices too but not for the newest one produced by Motorola.

Android One is a Google successful challenge to impose itself so well in the most difficult markets and, if it ever came to our market, it could definitely beat the competitors.

<p>Parallax scrolling has become mainstream. You definitely have encountered it wether you checked the <a href="http://journey.lifeofpimovie.com">website</a> of one of the recent blockbusters or the latests <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone-5c/">Apple products</a>.</p>

<p>I was looking how to recreate these effects and I found a javascript library that promises wonders: <a href="https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr">Skrollr</a>
It&rsquo;s javascript framework agnostic and it&rsquo;s mobile and desktop ready.</p>

<p>The tutorial is well done and you can find a bunch of examples <a href="https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr/tree/master/examples">here</a>.
The library adds a <code>skrollable</code> class to all the elements it controls and it has 3 main classes <code>skrollable-before, skrollable-between</code> and <code>skrollable-after</code> to describe the behaviour of the elements depending on their position during the scroll of the website.</p>

<p>Go and check the <a href="http://prinzhorn.github.io/skrollr/">demo</a> and start experimenting!</p>

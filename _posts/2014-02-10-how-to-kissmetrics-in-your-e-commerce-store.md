<p>Everyone knows &ldquo;how to Google Analytics in PrestaShop (i.e. PS)&rdquo; right?</p>
<p>If the answer is no then <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/search?search_query=google+analytics" target="_blank">here</a>. As always modules to the rescue! :)</p>
<p>Yes I know they aren&rsquo;t free :(</p>
<p>Ok now do you know KISSmetrics? If the answer is no then <a href="https://www.kissmetrics.com/">here</a> :)</p>
<p>Now if you want to integrate this analytic product in your PS store I can suggest you <a href="https://github.com/mikamai/kissmetrics-handler">this</a> free module that I&rsquo;ve developed.</p>
<p>It is still &ldquo;young&rdquo; and it is built for the major release 1.4 of PS.</p>
<p>But if you have the latest major release (i.e. PS 1.5) don&rsquo;t despair! If there is interest in this module the porting will be done in a couple of days :)</p>

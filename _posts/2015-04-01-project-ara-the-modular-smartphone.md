<i>“The smartphone is one of the most empowering and intimate objects in our lives. Yet most of us have little say in how the device is made, what it does, and how it looks. And 5 billion of us don’t have one. What if you could make thoughtful choices about exactly what your phone does, and use it as a creative canvas to tell your own story?  </i>

<i>Introducing Project Ara.</i>

<i>Designed exclusively for 6 billion people.”</i>

<b>The project Ara</b> aims to create a modular smartphone, composed of a main body with a set of slots where you can insert the desired components. Each component is a module in its own right and it is exchangeable at any time, thus increasing the life cycle of the product.

<figure class="tmblr-full"><img class="size-full wp-image-712 aligncenter" src="https://dev.mikamai.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Spiral-2-prototype_105.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="700" /></figure>The main body will be available in three sizes, “mini”, a frame about the size of a Nokia 3310, “medium”, about the size of a LG Nexus 5, and a “large” frame about the size of a Samsung Galaxy Note 3.

Among the possible modules we can find cameras, batteries and other components that can be found on every smartphone today, but some modules that bring about completely new features will be available as well. There will be medical devices, night sensors, projectors and more.Each slot has a default size and modules can occupy one or more slots.

The new MDK was created in collaboration with many companies including NK Labs, LeafLabs, New Deal Design, Metamorph Software, X5 Systems, Toshiba, Mixel, Quanta, Opersys, Linux Solutions, Linaro, BayLibre, NewOldBits, Oxford Systems, Foxconn and IDT Systems.

It seems that everything could become a module of Ara, a part of it.

<i>And you, yeah you, are you ready to be part of it?</i>

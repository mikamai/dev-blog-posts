<p>Don&rsquo;t you know PrestaShop (PS)?<br />Take a look <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/en/about-us">here</a> :)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a modular system that let you create a rich e-commerce platform by supporting a vast number of different features. These features are implemented via modules that hooks right into the core of PS.</p>
<p>There are a lot of modules, free and not, and the community is pretty active. Some of them are released together with PS and are directly developed by the PS group.</p>
<p>However some of them are limited (e.g. Cash On Delivery) and so&hellip;developers to the rescue!</p>
<p>There are a lot of custom modules posted in the PS dedicated <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/forums/forum/144-free-modules/">forum section</a> but actually you can also directly fork PS from <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop">GitHub</a>, develop your changes to the core modules, and then ask a pull request.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/211738-modulo-contrassegno-con-maggiorazione-cod-15/">example</a> of the over mentioned Cash On Delivery module enriched with the possibility to add a custom fee.<br />I&rsquo;ve added this feature too and published the modified version of the module on <a href="https://github.com/fusillicode/cashondelivery">GitHub</a>. Actually I didn&rsquo;t fork the entire PS repo but I&rsquo;ve just created one with only my module.</p>

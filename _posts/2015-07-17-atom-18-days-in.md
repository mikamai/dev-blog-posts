<p>I wanted to give you a quick update on my <a href="http://dev.mikamai.com/post/122755410549/a-month-long-atom-test-drive-from-an-emacs-fanatic">Atom test drive</a>, 18 days in, as it  keeps going.</p><p>First things first: IT IS SLOW. This is actually so bad that even if I like everything else (and I am liking it), I might drop Atom because of that. </p><p>Apart from the abysmal performance, Atom looks nice, and, while I have to be careful not to hit Emacs chords, all the keyboard defaults are nice.</p><p>Here’s a list of plugins I am using for now. It will probably grow as I use it more, and I will probably remove something, but here it is:</p><ul><li>git-blame-plus (but I have no idea what it does, I liked the name)</li><li>git-plus (nice git integration, but definitely not <a href="https://github.com/magit/magit">magit</a>)</li><li>language-docker (you know, I love Docker)</li><li>markdown-pdf (after all pdf is the <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJ98l5HUEAATkNB.png">4th most popular religion</a>)</li><li>minimap</li><li>tree-view-git-status</li></ul><p>For visual pleasure, and that’s one of the most important reasons to switch to Atom:</p><ul><li>seti-ui<br /></li><li>seti-syntax</li></ul><p><a href="http://parappatherapper.wikia.com/wiki/Kick!_Punch!#Lyrics">That’s it for today!</a></p>

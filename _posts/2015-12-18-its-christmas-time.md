Here we are, this year too. It’s one week to Christmas and 2016 is just around the corner.
<!--more-->

As the regular reader may have already noticed Ruby is our preferred language: during 2015 there were no loud news in the ruby world, but Rails 5 was planned for this fall (so it should not be long before its release), while [Lotus](https://dev.mikamai.com/2015/06/24/lotus-one-year-later/), an alternative framework that aims to bring a breath of fresh air in the development of web apps with ruby, is quickly approaching the v1.0 release.

What interested us the most during 2015 was the chitchat about [Elixir](https://dev.mikamai.com/2015/01/29/brainfuck-in-elixir-part-three-compiling/) and a new upcoming language, [Crystal](http://crystal-lang.org). Both of them can be a nice complement to Ruby and both of them spot an awesome syntax, very similar to the Ruby one. While Elixir is mainly a modern syntax for the old-but-powerful Erlang, Crystal can be seen like [Go](https://dev.mikamai.com/2015/10/12/writing-ruby-extensions-in-go-an-in-depth-review/) written by rubysts.

In the end 2015 has been far from a boring year and we expect 2016 to be even better. For 2016 you can surely expect more posts on these hot-topics (Lotus, Elixir and Crystal) and of course the usual coverage on our consolidated best-known techs.

And maybe, if the time will be on our side, we’ll even work on a restyle of this blog :)

Merry Christmas and a happy new year from MIKAMAI :-)

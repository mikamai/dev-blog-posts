<p>We&rsquo;re happy, if not proud, of introducing <a href="http://railsrumble.com/entries/36-mikamayhem" title="Instarecipe" target="_blank">our entry in the 2012 Rails Rumble competition</a>: <a href="http://instarecipe.com" title="Instarecipe" target="_blank">Instarecipe</a>.</p>
<p>Instarecipe is a simple application that allows you to search for recipes and tries to give you results as fast as possible.</p>
<p>It also integrates some external social media, allowing you to post on facebook and pinterest, and watch videos, taken from youtube, on how to make your favorite recipes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d love to teach you how to use it, but it&rsquo;s pretty simple. Run to <a href="http://instarecipe.com" title="Instarecipe" target="_blank">instarecipe.com</a>Â and start searching!</p>
<p>The application has been coded in around 30 hours during <a href="http://48rails.it" title="48rails" target="_blank">48rails</a>, an Italian competition parallel to Rails Rumble.</p>
<p>We used Ruby, a lot of Javascript, and several graphic assets found around the Internet.</p>
<p>We had lots of fun building it, and hope you&rsquo;ll have fun playing with it :)</p>

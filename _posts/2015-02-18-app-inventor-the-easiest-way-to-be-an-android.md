<b>App Inventor</b> is a blocks-based programming tool that allows everyone, even novices, to start programming and build fully functional apps for Android devices.

With App Inventor anyone could be a mobile developer and have his first simple Android app in less than one hour.

App Inventor provides to “developers” two types of interfaces, called a <b>Designer</b> and <b>Blocks</b>.

In the <b>Designer</b> screen the user can manage the visual part of the application, defining the screen layout and placing the various components with a simple drag-and-drop. For each component it’s also be possible to set a number of properties.

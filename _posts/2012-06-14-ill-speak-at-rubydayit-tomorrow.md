<p>I was asked to write about the talk I&rsquo;ll give tomorrow at <a href="http://rubyday.it">RubyDay.it</a>.</p>
<p>Without giving away too much here&rsquo;s a post I wrote some time ago about <a href="http://elia.schito.me/post/17547757285/another-reason-to-avoid-instance-variables-into-rails"><code>@instance_variables usage in Rails implementation</code></a>.</p>
<p>Last I add a promise: <em>it will be fun!</em></p>

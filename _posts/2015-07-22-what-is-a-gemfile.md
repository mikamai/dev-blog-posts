<a href='http://tosbourn.com/what-is-the-gemfile/'>What is a Gemfile</a><div class="link_description"><p>When you’re a ruby/rails novice, you’re told the Gemfile is used to list gems required by the project, but nobody cares too much about describing (or learning) the available  configuration options: after all, it’s just the gems list. </p><p>Sooner or later you will have problems with gems and Gemfiles, mainly compatibility and version issues, so it’s better to know what you’re dealing with.</p><p>If you strive for the Gemfile Master badge then go and read this article, it’s complete and well written, kudos to the author!</p></div>

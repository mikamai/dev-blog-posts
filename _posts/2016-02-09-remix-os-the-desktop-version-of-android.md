<i>“Android is everywhere, and there’s no surprise why. It’s powerful, flexible, and downright fun to use. Remix OS 2.0 is pioneering the next chapter of the Android journey.”</i>

Remix OS is an operating system based on Android 5.1 produced by Jide, a company founded by three ex employees of Google, which allows a full desktop experience of well-known operating system from Google.

Remix OS is presented with the look and the features of a standard OS for PCs. As in normal OS for PC you can open multiple apps simultaneously that will appear to the user as real windows and not in multi-windows mode as on smartphones. The windows can also be resized or minimized in the taskbar.

The taskbar is another hallmark of the approach of Android OS to the PC OS. In fact, the taskbar is always the starting point in using a computer and Jide has decided to introduce it in the project to make users feel more “at home”. In the task bar you can find the classic “start menu” with the list of installed applications and the “system tray” for handling connections. Also from here you can access the notifications that appear on the right side of the desktop a la Mac OS.

Remix OS also has a file manager and support for keyboards, mouse (including right click) and external storage devices.

It is possible to enjoy the flexibility of the operating system of the little green robot and tools that Android makes available to its smartphones. Users can install the Google Play Store in order to access and use all the applications that have made Android famous (with a little help from <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/remix/remix-os/app-install-google-play-services-remix-t3292087">XDA</a>).

Increasingly linking up with the mobile world, Remix OS is updated over the air, by notifying the user and explain in detail what are the changes.

If Remix OS in its first version was bound to Remix Mini, a mini pc product by Jide, it’s only in the version 2.0 that meets the general public and allows its installation on all PCs. Remix OS 2.0 is in fact installable on any USB stick with at least 8GB of space so you have your OS always with you.

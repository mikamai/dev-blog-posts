Google recently released Android Lollipop for devices bringing both graphic and functional changes.

After updating my Nexus 5 I noticed the presence of a strange toggle in the quick settings menu, the toggle labeled “invert colors”. Not knowing what it was I continued to turn it on and off trying in every way to hide it from the dropdown menu but with no results.

But there is a solution!

Some toggles in Android L are time dependent, they disappear after a certain amount of time if they are not activated, this period is of one month and a day. So you have to go back in time at least one month and a day, then you should turn on and off the toggle and return the device to the current date.

TADAAAAAM it’s gone!

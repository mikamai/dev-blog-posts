<p>Say hello to the first, unpolished version of <strong>Barebon</strong>!</p>
<p>Barebon is a simple skeleton boilerplate for <em>fast</em> static page prototyping. It provides a friendly environment for front-end developers who love <strong>Sass</strong> and <strong>CoffeeScript</strong>. It also comes with a super-easy <strong>Grunt</strong> configuration that helps you to start hacking on your project right away.</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Legit question! I absolutely love and use <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/" target="_blank">HTML5 boilerplate</a> and <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a>, but when it comes to super-simple static pages prototyping they&rsquo;re just&hellip; overkill. I just wanted a neat, easy &ldquo;framework&quot; for these kinds of websites.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;ve been enjoying Bourbon and Neat for a while I&rsquo;ve decided to give it a try and make something focused on that. I liked it, so I thought I could share it with teh internetz.</p>
<h3>How easy is it?</h3>
<p>VERY easy. If you already have npm and grunt-cli installed, you just need to fork the repo, get in the folder and run <strong>$ npm install</strong>. When done, you just need to spawn the grunt watcher (that includes a Livereload feature), and you can start hacking on your code! </p>
<h3>Gimme dat repository link already!</h3>
<p>Ok, ok! You can find <a href="https://github.com/iprignano/barebon" target="_blank">Barebon on Github</a>. Feel free to give it a try – any feedback is obviously appreciated!</p>

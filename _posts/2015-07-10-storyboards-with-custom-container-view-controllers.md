<a href='http://sandmoose.com/post/35714028270/storyboards-with-custom-container-view-controllers'>Storyboards With Custom Container View Controllers</a><div class="link_description"><p><b>UIContainerView</b> can be super useful while designing iOS/OS X apps, but unfortunately you are limited to <b>only one embed segue per container view</b>. Using this neat <b>workaround</b> from Michael Luton over at <a href="http://sandmoose.com">sandmoose.com</a> you can embed multiple view controllers in a single container view and decide programmatically which one to load at every given time!</p></div>

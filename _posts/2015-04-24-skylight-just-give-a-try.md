<p>Three months ago I&rsquo;ve started using <a href="https://www.skylight.io/">Skylight</a> as app monitor and profiler, and I&rsquo;m  very happy with it. Skylight relies on running an agent that collects performance information from Rails app. Skylight has a minimal and simple interface. In my experience having a large and overwhelming amount of information and metrics can be disorienting. Tools like New Relic come with a lot of features and graphs, but someimes you can&rsquo;t find the right information in the right place.</p><figure class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/94d2275ff61768dc58f22ca1a0f53142/tumblr_inline_nnay13ZiVY1qfdn20_540.png" /></figure><p>I definitely suggest trying Skylight out to profile your application.</p><p>You can try Skylight for free on Heroku. The <a href="https://docs.skylight.io/getting-started/">installation</a> is super simple and the installation screen provides real-time feedback during gem installation and configuration.</p>

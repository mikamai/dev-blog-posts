<p>Some time ago in this blog <a href="http://dev.mikamai.com/post/100661549394/welcome-to-the-material-design-era">we reported about Google Material Design</a>, an evolution of Apple Flat Design. But what is Material Design, really? And what are good design principles for an app to be Material-Design-ready?</p>

<h4>What did Google designers do?</h4>
<!--more-->


<p>They created a visual language that summarizes the classical principles of good design. They wanted to offer a unified experience across several platforms. The graphics creates a hierarchy that guides the user in navigation, where shadows and movement take on a clear meaning: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8TXgCzxEnw">just look at this video example</a></p>

<h4>The tactile surfaces (quantum paper)</h4>

<p>Virtually every element of a graphical user interface becomes a real surface. Each element acquires realistic shadow because they are structured in a hierarchical manner, one above the other.</p>

<h4>Colors</h4>

<p>As in Apple Flat Design bright colors dominate the scene, combined through the use of soft spots.</p>

<h4>Font</h4>

<p>Google adopted the Roboto font to dominate in the new graphical environment. Readability is further enhanced by playing with contrast.</p>

<h4>Images</h4>

<p>The imperative is to maintain integrity of the original images.
Invasive filters should be avoided (desaturation is ok, though).</p>

<h4>Icons</h4>

<p>Icons should be modern, brightly colored, eccentric and minimal just like in Flat Design.</p>

<h4>Animations</h4>

<p>Designers at Google have focused on the fact that animations within a graphical interface have to be really sensible and most of all consistent with the user experience in that moment. An animation must be a consequence of a gesture, hence of an intention of the user. It is very important that the animation starts exactly where the user clicked or touched.</p>

<p>Material is becoming the new trend also in graphic design with its forms, its structure and its colors.
This is a sign that Google has managed to combine in a single design language, those that have been the trends over the last 5 or 6 years in the world of technology and design, taking the best from each of them and being able to create something innovative thanks to the &lsquo;material&rsquo; metaphor.</p>

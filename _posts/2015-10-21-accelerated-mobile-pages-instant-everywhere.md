New technologies and new devices have definitely changed the way we design and develop the web.

Now every user can see every website on mobile devices thanks to an adaptive layout but the real problem is the loading time of contents. Users want to enjoy the contents of a website in real time but that is not always possible, especially if the websites is very rich of contents.

And here comes the ’<a href="https://www.ampproject.org/">Accelerated Mobile Pages Project</a>’

“For many, reading on the mobile web is a slow, clunky and frustrating experience - but it does not have to be that way. The Accelerated Mobile Pages (MPA) Project is an open source initiative that embodies the vision that publishers can create mobile optimized content once and have it load instantly everywhere. ”

AMP is a Google project that aims to develop a framework based on HTML5 for creating web pages mobile optimized.
Based on existing technologies, pages created with AMP will be perfectly compatible with browsers but keeping all the advantages of the new Google technology.

At present AMP is designed to be used only in static pages, but everyone can contribute to its improvement beginning with the <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml">GitHub repository</a>.

The pages created with AMP does not allow to include GitHub JavaScript code or third-part scripts. This was decided to make pages more fluid and because JS is rarely used in static pages. If JavaScrips is necessary the developer can include AMP custom elements. This allows to exploit both the potential of JavaScript that those of AMP.
For the look and feel of pages AMP use standard CSS file, fully supported by the framework.

To summarize: “AMP HTML is a specialized subset of HTML elements with custom that provides reliable performance and instant loading of static content. Nothing about the project is september in stone. We are sharing an early version of the AMP HTML spec as well as a prototype implementation on GitHub and we are looking forward to collaborating with the community on all aspects of the project. ”

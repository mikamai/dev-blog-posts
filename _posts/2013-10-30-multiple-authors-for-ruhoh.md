Recently we spent a bit of time trying to setup a better, faster and nerdier alternative for our developers blog. If we could host our blog on github it would be really nerd like.

[Ruhoh](http://ruhoh.com/) seems to be a [better alternative](http://dickfeynman.ruhoh.com/technical/playing-with-ruhoh/) over [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), so we tried to setup a static blog using it, but it requires to replicate the post author info on each post, and this is not DRY!

We ended up writing a small plugin for this called:Â [Ruhoh Multiple Authors](https://github.com/mikamai/ruhoh-multiple_authors)

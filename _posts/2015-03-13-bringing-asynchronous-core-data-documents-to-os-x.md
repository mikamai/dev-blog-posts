<a href='http://cutecoder.org/programming/asynchronous-core-data-document/'>Bringing Asynchronous Core Data documents to OS X | Making the Switch</a><div class="link_description"><p>Core Data provides very powerful tools for managing data persistency on iOS and OS X, but unfortunately Apple hasnâ€™t brought NSManagedDocument and all its cool features (like auto-saving and background I/O) to OS X yet. This is a good way to make up for it by using NSPersistentDocument.</p></div>

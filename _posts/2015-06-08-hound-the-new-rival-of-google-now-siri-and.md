After 10 years of work SoundHound, platform for the recognition of music, releases its voice assistant Hound.

<figure class="tmblr-full"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/c118db4413ab0deef77e6a8ae9380cc4/tumblr_inline_npmolgBz9W1r9vg8d_540.png" /></figure><!--more-->

Only available for Android devices and in Beta, Hound aims to challenge the most popular Google Now, Siri and Cortana using a voice recognition system very similar to what humans use during a normal conversation. Hound uses the speech to meaning technique, unlike the usual speech to text, which not only allows the recognition of individual words but also the meaning of the sentence.

Definitely a novelty that will be much appreciated by the users so that they can express themselves in a much more natural than using keywords.

Currently the service is not yet active in Italy but as you can see from various videos on the Internet it has all it takes to carve out a slice of the market.

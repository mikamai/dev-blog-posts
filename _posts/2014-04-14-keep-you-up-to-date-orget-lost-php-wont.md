<p>PHP is getting some pretty nice feature on each new release.</p>
<p>However most of the versions provided by the hosting providers don&rsquo;t perfectly align with the evolution of the language.</p>
<p>In this situation you should really take care on how you write your code!</p>
<p>One example?</p>
<p>Function arrayÂ dereferencing or if you prefer:</p>
<pre>foo()[0]</pre>
<p>You like it eh ;)</p>
<p>Unfortunately this is available only up from version 5.4.0.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re handling some projects that are hosted on servers shipping an older version of the one over mentioned 5.4.0 think twice before start doing what you like :P</p>
<p>P.S: self experienced ;)</p>

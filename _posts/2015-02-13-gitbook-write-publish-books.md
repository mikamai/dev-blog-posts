<a href='http://gitbook.io'>GitBook · Write &amp; Publish Books</a><div class="link_description"><p>Writing is one of the oldest ways of sharing knowledge and programmers love to share their knowledge, either because they have giant egos or because their work includes writing a lot of documentation.</p>

<p>The most popular writing tools are focused on short posts, sometimes we call them articles, sometimes they span a few pages, but still the workflow is based on short essays, they are simply not good enough when things become bigger.</p>

<p><a href="http://gitbook.io">Gitbook</a> is different: Gitbook helps you to write a complete book, from start to finish, using de facto standard technologies, very well known across programmer&rsquo;s community (GIT for storing, Markdown for writing).   </p>

<p>Gitbook is targetted to those writing documentation for APIs or <a href="http://book.voltframework.com/">a reactive framework</a>, but also scientists, teachers and  writers in general.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/editor">online editor</a> is simply great, but if you prefer, there is also a <a href="https://github.com/GitbookIO/editor/releases">multi platform desktop application</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.gitbook.com/pricing">Gitbook pricing</a> includes a free plan, that allows you to use all the features of the platform: reviews, convertion engine (PDF, ePub, Mob) and publishing (free or paid) on <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/explore">Gitbook  catalogue</a>. <br />
If you&rsquo;re willing to pay, you can publish on commercial platforms too, such as Amazon, Google Play Store and iBooks Store.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://github.com/intinig">Giovanni</a> would say «You must have something to write, first», but if you got it (or need it), give <a href="http://gitbook.io">Gitbook</a> a try.</p></div>

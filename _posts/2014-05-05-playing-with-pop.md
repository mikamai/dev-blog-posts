<p>A couple of weeks ago Facebook shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiY1cheLpmI">video </a> with some behind the curtains details about the realisation of Paper, their iOS new fancy client.</p>

<p>Among the talks a bomb was released: they were going to open source their animation framework POP, and <a href="http://github.com/facebook/pop">they finally did</a>!</p>

<p>POP it has been released for iOS and OSX, it can animate everything, not only CGLayers, you can even animate volume or other object&rsquo;s properties.</p>

<p>And to whet your appetite before heading to the repo check Codeplease&rsquo;s  <a href="http://codeplease.io/tag/pop-facebook/">posts on POP</a></p>

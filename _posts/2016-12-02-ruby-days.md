As many people found out with dismay, this year’s <a href="http://www.rubyday.it/" target="_blank">Rubyday</a> coincided with another big event, the <a href="http://milan2016.codemotionworld.com/" target="_blank">Codemotion</a> here in Milan. In Mikamai we rolled out a ‘divide and conquer’ plan, so while <a href="https://twitter.com/fusillicode" target="_blank">@fusillicode</a> was -super-efficiently as usual- covering Codemotion, three of us set out for Florence. <!--more-->Tiny adv block: at our stand we were giving away the lovely Mikamai mug, so if you weren’t so lucky as to get one, be sure to be there next year!

<figure class="tmblr-full"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/1bba8a356ef4fb37db9261d6fa0001cc/tumblr_inline_ohjzw2GqjC1sjjac8_540.jpg" /></figure>This was my first time at RubyDay and I was positively impressed at how international the event was. As I am not a developer, some of the talks were a bit out of my depth, nonetheless I could appreciate their quality. <a href="https://twitter.com/arkh4m" target="_blank">@arkh4m</a>’s flamboyant Elixir-on-Raspberry demo, <a href="https://twitter.com/jodosha" target="_blank">@jodosha</a>’s passionate portrayal of contributing to open-source and <a href="https://twitter.com/nusco" target="_blank">@nusco</a>’s recursive non-defense of refinements were highlights at least for me.

I was curious to take part to <a href="https://twitter.com/andreareginato" target="_blank">@andreareginato</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/realfuzzy" target="_blank">@realfuzzy</a>’s workshop about what it means to be a fullstack and what is the true benefit they can bring to a team. Michele and Andrea’s conclusions were quite deep and thought-provoking, however I feel that they suffered somewhat of the workshop being the last of Saturday afternoon and everybody being a bit out of gas.

On a different note, a talk which was unexpectedly engaging for me was <a href="https://twitter.com/adamzdanielle" target="_blank">@adamzdanielle</a>’s feat about writing Ruby methods that are faster than Ruby’s own. I found Danielle’s talk to be insightful as well as entertaining and I think that having more women in the dev (Ruby) community is as much a matter of introducing young women to the joys and sorrows of the trade - which was the topic of a different talk in the morning – as it is a matter of supporting the excellent work done by many lady coders out there.

I had a great time at RubyDay this year and I hope next year I will be able to attend again, meeting people who share the same love of clean code and that share thoughts and experiences for making it even better.
